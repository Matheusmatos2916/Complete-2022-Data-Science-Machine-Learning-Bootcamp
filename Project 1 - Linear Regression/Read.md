#  "Predict Movie Box Office Revenue with Linear Regression - Movie: Zombies Rise Again - Part 5"

The purpose of this repository is to present a movie box office revenue forecast project using the linear regression technique. The film chosen for this project is "Zombies Rise Again - Part 5". The prediction accuracy is 55%, which means that the developed model is able to predict the film's box office revenue with an acceptable margin of error.

The project was developed in Python and makes use of libraries such as Pandas, NumPy and Scikit-learn. The dataset used to train and test the model was collected from various sources such as IMDb, Box Office Mojo and The Numbers. The data was organized, cleaned and explored to identify the most relevant variables for predicting the film's box office revenue.

The linear regression model was trained based on variables such as the film's production budget, cast, genre, and release date. After training, the model was evaluated with a technical statistic to measure its accuracy in predicting the film's box office revenue.

The results indicate that the developed model is able to predict the box office revenue of the movie "Zombies Rise Again - Part 5" with an accuracy of 55%. This means that the prediction can be considered reasonable, but there is still room for improvement in the model.

This repository can be used as a reference for projects to forecast movie box office revenue using linear regression. The project's source code and the data used are available for download, allowing other researchers and developers to reproduce and improve the developed model.
