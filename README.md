# Complete 2022 Data Science Machine Learning Bootcamp

The purpose of this repository is to present the completion project of the course "Complete 2022 Data Science Machine Learning Bootcamp". This course is aimed at those who want to learn the skills needed to become a data scientist or machine learning expert.

The course is taught by data science and machine learning experts who guide students on a journey of hands-on learning. Topics covered include data analysis, data visualization, data pre-processing, supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and much more.

The course completion project is the perfect opportunity for students to apply everything they've learned to a hands-on project. The project consists of creating a machine learning model that is able to predict something with acceptable accuracy.

The repository contains all the source code and data used to develop the machine learning model. The project was developed in Python and made use of libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn.

The course conclusion project is a perfect example of how the knowledge acquired in the course can be applied in practice. Furthermore, the repository can be used as a reference for future machine learning projects.

Thanks to the instructors and the Complete 2022 Data Science Machine Learning Bootcamp course for the learning opportunity and hands-on experience of developing a machine learning project. We hope this repository can be useful for other students and professionals who want to learn about data science and machine learning.
